Payce is modernizing the way businesses operate - starting with Revenue. We aim to completely automate the accounts receivable process, putting the tools to run it back into the right hands. 

With accounting automation as our data layer, we aim to build tools that accelerate growth, and optimize cash flow.

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
